On the scale of urban food systems, we need to understand the availability of food resources crossed with the socio-economic profiles of the territories. But we lack tools and methods to systematically understand the relationships between consumption basins, supply and eating habits. The objective of this thesis is to contribute to the development of new IT tools to process temporal, heterogeneous and multi-sources data in order to identify and characterize behaviors specific to a geographic area. For this, we rely on the joint exploration of gradual patterns, to discover rank correlations, and subgroups in order to find contexts for which the correlations described by the gradual patterns are exceptionally strong compared to the remaining of the data. We propose an enumeration algorithm based on pruning properties with upper bounds, as well as another algorithm which samples the patterns according to the quality measure. These approaches are validated not only on benchmark datasets, but also through an empirical study of the formation of food deserts in the Lyon urban area.",
