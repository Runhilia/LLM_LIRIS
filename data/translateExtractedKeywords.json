            "Model selection methods based on stochastic regularization such as Dropout have been widely used in deep learning due to their simplicity and effectiveness. The standard Dropout method treats all units, visible or hidden, in the same way, thus ignoring any \\emph{a priori} information related to grouping or structure. Such structure is present in multi-modal learning applications such as affect analysis and gesture recognition, where subsets of units may correspond to individual modalities. In this paper we describe Modout, a model selection method based on stochastic regularization, which is particularly useful in the multi-modal setting. Different from previous methods, it is capable of learning whether or when to fuse two modalities in a layer, which is usually considered to be an architectural hyper-parameter by deep learning researchers and practitioners. Modout is evaluated on one synthetic and two real multi-modal datasets. The results indicate improved performance compared to other stochastic regularization methods. The result on the Montalbano dataset shows that learning a fusion structure by Modout is on par with a state-of-the-art carefully designed architecture."

            "In this paper we present a new framework for subdivision surface approximation of 3D models represented by polygonal meshes. Our approach, particularly suited for mechanical or CAD parts, produces a mixed quadrangle-triangle control mesh, optimized in terms of face and vertex numbers while remaining independent of the connectivity of the input mesh. Our algorithm begins with a decomposition of the object into surface patches. Then the main idea is to approximate first the region boundaries and then the interior data. Thus, for each patch, a first step approximates the boundaries with subdivision curves (associated with control polygons) and creates an initial subdivision surface by linking the boundary control points with respect to the lines of curvature of the target surface. Then, a second step optimizes the initial subdivision surface by iteratively moving control points and enriching regions according to the error distribution. The final control mesh defining the whole model is then created assembling every local subdivision control meshes. This control polyhedron is much more compact than the original mesh and visually represents the same shape after several subdivision steps, hence it is particularly suitable for compression and tasks visualization. Experiments conducted on several mechanical models have proven the coherence and the efficiency of our algorithm, compared with existing methods."

The proposed tool is not linked to any specific application and thus can be used to evaluate any kinds of 3D mesh processing algorithms (simplification, compression, watermarking etc.). This measure follows the concept of structural similarity recently introduced for 2D image quality assessment by Wang \\emph{et al.} \\cite{WANG:2004} and is based on curvature analysis (mean, standard deviation, covariance) on local windows of the meshes. Evaluation and comparison with geometric metrics are done through a subjective experiment based on human evaluation of a set of distorted objects. A quantitative perceptual metric is also derived from the proposed structural distortion measure, for the specific case of watermarking quality assessment, and is compared with recent state of the art algorithms. Both visual and quantitative results demonstrate the robustness of our approach and its strong correlation with subjective ratings."

            "Evaluation of object detection algorithms is a non-trivial task: a detection result is usually evaluated by comparing the bounding box of the detected object with the bounding box of the ground truth object. The commonly used precision and recall measures are computed from the overlap area of ​​these two rectangles. However, these measures have several drawbacks: they don't give intuitive information about the proportion of the correctly detected objects and the number of false alarms, and they cannot be accumulated across multiple images without creating ambiguity in their interpretation. Furthermore, quantitative and qualitative evaluation is often mixed resulting in ambiguous measures. In this paper we propose an approach to evaluation which tackles these problems. The performance of a detection algorithm is illustrated intuitively by performance graphs which present object level precision and recall depending on constraints on detection quality. In order to compare different detection algorithms, a representative single performance value is computed from the graphs. The evaluation method can be applied to different types of object detection algorithms. It has been tested on different text detection algorithms, among which are the participants of the Image Eval text detection competition."
