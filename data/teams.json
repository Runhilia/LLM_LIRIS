            "description": "Origami is a team dedicated to computer graphics and covers all aspects of this discipline, with three main themes: geometry, rendering and simulation. In digital geometry, our work focuses on the development of algorithms for the analysis and creation of meshes, point clouds, digital surfaces and procedural shapes for virtual worlds. In rendering, we focus on the simulation of lighting, sampling, virtual reality and perception. Finally, in simulation, we develop deformation and fluid models, as well as their discretization: M2Disco, Ream, Geomod.",

The various research activities carried out by the Imagine team share the same general objectives of understanding multi-source and multi-sensor images, thus integrating a very wide variety of content around images of people, objects and scenes in 2D and 3D, image sequences and video streams, as well as digitized documents (maps, written and printed texts, scores and symbols...). The notion of the visual object, in the broadest sense, is thus a common denominator in our research. The Imagine team's activities are divided into different themes linked to the implementation of methods for indexing, modeling, classifying and recognizing content (objects, actions, concepts), with a particular focus on the development of machine learning methods for computer vision. The research carried out by the Imagine team aims to build bridges across the semantic divide between, on the one hand, the low-level information present in raw data (sampled data from signals), possible multi-source data from other modalities or sensors (particularly in the case of embedded applications) and, on the other hand, the higher-level semantic information based on content modeling, classification and identification.",

The team's activities focus on the principles, techniques and applications of data management systems. In this context, the data to be considered are produced by a variety of sources (conventional data, sensor data, data from services, etc.) and the applications rely on a variety of storage media (e.g. RAM, Flash, disk) with very different technical characteristics. We borrow our methods from the fields of databases, both at the theoretical level (algebraic and logical languages, data dependencies) and at the system level (storage techniques, indexing and query optimization).Our scientific objectives focus on data storage, querying and analysis, but also on data/service coupling, declarative query languages for new applications - notably intelligent buildings - and data confidentiality and security. The team structures its activities around the following three themes: Theme 1: Management of dynamic environments. Theme 2: Data quality, integrity and availability. Theme 3: Security and confidentiality of data and services.  It should be noted that the application theme of intelligent buildings has mobilized many of the team's permanent staff across the three themes.",

The fundamental research of team members concerns the study of structures (plunging, decompositions, matchings, etc.) and optimization parameters on graphs (colorations, identifications, combinatorial games, etc.). Algorithms. The algorithmic dimension concerns the study of complexity and the development of efficient algorithms for highlighting properties or evaluating parameters on graphs. These algorithms can be sequential, distributed, self-stabilizing or dynamic. Applications. The GOAL team is interested in the applications of graphs in Big Data, the Web, distributed architectures and security, among others.",

Our research in this field is part of a constructivist vision, considering representations as dynamic constructs that the computer system elaborates on the basis of its experience of interaction with its environment, and through learning mechanisms and self* mechanisms (self-organization, self-adaptation, self-development) that enable its autonomy. Research topics: Multi-Agent Learning, Self-* Systems and Autonomy, Interaction and Coordination Models. We are involved in the main themes of assistance systems, including service robotics for dependent people, with a strong focus on mechanism design, transport regulation and intelligent energy management.",

            "description": "The work of the TWEAK team falls within the disciplines of symbolic artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering (KE), and more specifically explores two dimensions: HALEs (Computer Environments for Human Learning) and the Web. We are particularly interested in the explicability of the processes implemented by the systems we develop, and in the co-evolution of user-machine systems within computerized environments, adopting a knowledge-oriented point of view. We evaluate our proposals through prototypes and tools that we experiment with in a number of fields, from MOOCs to the Web of Things. Our work in IC focuses in particular on knowledge dynamics engineering, in which modeled traces constitute a representation of experience and an important source of knowledge. We propose the notion of a Trace Base Management System, specified and implemented within an open platform. These systems, coupled with instrumentation of traced IT systems, place the user in a central role for the co-construction and exploitation of knowledge. To this end, we are developing the paradigm of Reasoning from Traced Experience, an interactive and dynamic process in which the transparency of automatic processing allows users to adapt it to their own needs. We also draw on the human and social sciences to support the reflexive use of activity traces. Our work in the field of EIAH aims to propose models for providing the various players in a learning situation (authors of educational content, teachers, learners) with tools designed to support learning. We argue that it is the acquisition of knowledge from these different actors that enables them to contribute to the implementation of a learning environment adapted to each individual's needs. As part of a competency-based approach, we aim to help teachers create pedagogical activities, monitor their students and implement adaptive teaching. Exploiting the traces of interaction between learners and an EIAH can also support the self-regulation of learning, through the creation of open competency profiles, enabling both the learner to set goals and the system to recommend personalized activities.

We position ourselves at the interface between computer science and the life sciences, in order to generate new knowledge in biology through modeling and simulation. In other words, we create artifacts - from the Latin artis factum (an entity created by man rather than nature) - and explore them in order to understand nature. Our research is therefore based on an interdisciplinary strategy: we develop computational formalisms and software tools for modeling complex systems in synergy with various biology teams with whom we maintain close links. This “digital sciences” (or computational sciences) approach enables us to study abstractions of biological systems or processes, in order to uncover the organizational principles of cellular systems in a systems biology perspective.",

            "description": "This division covers the entire image production chain, from modeling to image synthesis. In particular, it focuses upstream on problems of acquisition, modeling, analysis and synthesis of geometries in various forms (meshes, point clouds, digital geometries). It then focuses on problems of deformation and animation of these geometries via physical simulations. Finally, at the end of the chain come the issues of textures and rendering, whether physically realistic or real-time."

These objectives revolve around the implementation of methods and models for the recognition, analysis and understanding of these contents, in a controlled articulation between the contributions of computer vision and machine learning."

            "description": "In computer science, discrete and combinatorial structures are used to model a wide range of objects: networks, databases, tables, images, web services... This division brings together teams seeking to understand the fundamental properties governing these structures, and then to design and analyze algorithms for these same objects. Research in this division is both structural (existence of combinatorial properties, enumeration, construction of new discrete models) and algorithmic (calculation of theoretical complexity, exact and approximate algorithms, distributed algorithms, verification and formal proofs)."

To achieve this, we use a variety of computer and mathematical tools. We digitally reproduce elements of the universe that surrounds us, in order to conduct virtual experiments or anticipate the design of artificial objects. By its very nature, this division is multidisciplinary, with strong links to various fields of biology, physics, medicine and engineering."

            "description": "The research carried out in this division aims to study and design dynamic systems in which several agents, human or software, interact. The focus is on studying the properties (cognitive, behavioral, emotional, etc.) of both individual agents and the resulting system. In this area, agents are considered as objects of study, with the aim of developing models/systems that exhibit individual and collective intelligence, reasoning, decentralized processing and control, and adaptation. The user-machine pair is seen as a single learning system, co-evolving as a function of the activities carried out."
